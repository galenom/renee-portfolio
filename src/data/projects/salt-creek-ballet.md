Salt Creek Ballet was established in 1985 to present professional quality dance programming to west-suburban audiences, provide high-level performance opportunities for area dancers, and encourage appreciation and awareness of dance in an underserved area. The Companyâ€™s high standards and unique blend of major classical productions and artistically diverse and challenging repertory programs (including works set for the Company by both resident and guest choreographers) have brought critical acclaim, sold-out performances, and a loyal following.
