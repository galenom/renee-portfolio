Geekjar is a gaming youtube channel inspired by everything GEEK. Originally, Geekjar had created a logo mark playing off of their name, and when I created the first and second version of their logo, I kept the jar as their mark, and essentially\"upgraded\"the jar's overall look. The colors I chose are from the first logo that they created, still keeping within their existing brand identity.
